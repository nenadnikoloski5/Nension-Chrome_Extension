# Nension - Chrome Extension
A Google Chrome extension which let's you view Reddit images easily
<br>

I don't like the new Reddit design, so I always use the old one, but it's annoying opening every picture in a subreddit manually, this is where the extension comes in. With a single press, all pictures will be maximized. Originally, I was going to make them all open in a new tab, but browsers don't allow you to do this :( 


 
 # How to install
  - You have to do this on Chrome!
